# Architecture of the [Yocto] project for [DC]

The project is spread over several [git] repositories containing a [Yocto] project layer or the sources of a software component.
These repositories are unified by the [repo] tool.

[TOC]{#toc}

# [Yocto] structure
The [Yocto] structure goal is to be generic for all the existent and future data concentrators.
The [Yocto] mirror layers and the BSP layers are meant to be shared by all teams.
The French and Finland teams can then, in their own layers (meta-application-fr and meta-application-fi) define their own images, while sharing the maximum amount of work.
This should reduce duplicated work to a minimum.

[Yocto] project is managed using gerrit and therefore deposited in different [git] repositories.
There are two types:
* **sources repositories**: for tracking [L+G] sources and mirroring external sources.
* **layer repositories**: for tracking or mirroring layers [recipes] and relevant material.

## Manifests
The `DC/manifests` contains google [repo] manifests for [DC].
It contains [repo] manifest files describing the directories that are visible and where they should be obtained from with [git].

## Generic layers
Generic [Yocto] layers which are mirrored on gerrit.
Latest LTS branch for those layers : kirkstone.

| Generic layers               |         |                                                                   |

## [L+G] BSP layer
[L+G] specific layers created and managed by the French [DC] team at Montlu√ßon.
The [L+G] BSP layer contains contains the [recipes] to build the [Linux] [kernel] and the u-boot bootloader tools for the [DC450]S4 and other machines.
The [Linux] and u-boot tools sources are respectively hosted in DC/linux and DC/u-boot repositories.
The [Linux] 5.4 LTS revision and the 2012.02 u-boot revision are used.

## [L+G] system layer
The meta-system layer contains the [recipes] which are hardware specific.
For now it contains the u-log [recipe] that is used to fetch u-boot logs on [Linux].

| `DC/u-log`                   | sources | Tool to read U-Boot logs from [Linux] userspace.                  |

## [L+G] common application layer
This layer contains the application [recipes] that will be shared between Finland and France [DC] teams.
For now it contains [recipes] dedicated to the HSM module and the security service on the [Linux] side.
