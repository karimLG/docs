# DC presentation
In a smart grid, the DC is a bridge between the information system and the meters.
It is responsible for collecting data from meters and providing it to the information system.
The DC is used to control each meter and to manage the PLC network.

Currently the project is dedicated to DC450 and CRx devices.
